## Project Structure
- `main.go`: Main Go application entry point

- `lb.h`: Shared header for eBPF and Go
- `makefile`: Build instructions
- `go.mod`, `go.sum`: Go module files

## DONE
- [x] SNAT / DNAT
- [x] Checksum calculation

## In Progress
- [ ] TCP state tracker

## Next Steps / TODO
- [ ] Logic for select backend
- [ ] Ensures that all packets belonging to the same TCP connection are consistently forwarded to the same backend server
- [ ] IPv6 support
- [ ] support for encapsulation (VXLAN, VLAN)
